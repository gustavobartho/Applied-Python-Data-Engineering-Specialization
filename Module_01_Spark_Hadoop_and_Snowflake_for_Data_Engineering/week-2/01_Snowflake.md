# **SnowFlake**

Snowflake is a storage and computation platform designed for big data. It runs as a service on public clouds, including on AWS,
Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud. Snowflake uses its own Snowflake SQL, so it's not using a version of SQL designed by another data product. 

## **Big Data Storage**
in terms of approaches to big data storage, there's a number of ways things have been done

* **Shared Everything**: This is the traditional approach and the simplest approach. In traditional database systems, the database is installed on a server, and all computations or processes are executed on the same server where the data resides. This approach works well for many applications that don’t involve large datasets. Typically, you’ll use a relational database hosted on a server, and interactions with the data happen directly through this server. When data becomes too large to process efficiently on a single server, this solutions struggle.

* **Shared Disk**: In this approach multiple computational nodes perform computations but share a common storage system. In this model, each node accesses the same data from a shared storage pool. However, a key drawback is that computational efficiency can be hindered when multiple nodes attempt to access the same data simultaneously, leading to contention and delays. This approach can be effective for certain workloads, but as the data size grows, the system may struggle to maintain performance, making it less suitable for large-scale data processing.

* **Shared Nothing**: In this case, each computational node has its own dedicated storage. 

Snowflake employs a hybrid architecture that combines elements of both `shared-disk` and `shared-nothing` models. Persistent data is stored in shared storage, while each processing node holds its own local copy of a subset of the data for processing. This design enables efficient concurrent processing while maintaining the simplicity of shared persistent storage.

## **Accessing Snowflake**

Here's a step-by-step guide for accessing Snowflake for the first time:

* Step 1 - **Sign Up for a Snowflake Account**: Go to the Snowflake website (https://www.snowflake.com/) and sign up for an account. You may need to provide your email address and some basic information.

* Step 2 - **Receive Access Credentials**: After signing up, you will receive access credentials, including a username and password. Keep these credentials secure.

* Step 3 - **Log In to the Snowflake Web Interface** Open a web browser and go to the Snowflake web interface (https://login.snowflake.com/). Enter your username and password to log in.

* Step 4 - **Explore the Snowflake UI**: Once logged in, explore the Snowflake user interface. Familiarize yourself with the navigation menu, where you can access different sections like Worksheets, Databases, Warehouses, and Worksheets.

* Step 5 - **Create a Database**: In Snowflake, data is organized into databases. To get started, create a new database where you can store your data. Click on "Databases" in the navigation menu, then click "Create Database." Follow the prompts to configure your database, including setting a name and optional settings.

* Step 6 - **Set Up a Warehouse**: A warehouse in Snowflake represents the computing resources available for running queries and processing data. You can create a new warehouse or use an existing one. Click on "Warehouses" in the navigation menu, then click "Create Warehouse." Configure the warehouse settings, such as size and scaling options.

* Step 7 - **Load Data**: To work with data in Snowflake, you need to load it into your database. You can load data from various sources, including cloud storage or local files. Go to the "Worksheets" section and create a new worksheet. Write SQL commands to load data into your database tables.

* Step 8 - **Query Data**: With your data loaded, you can start running SQL queries to analyze and manipulate it. In the worksheet, write SQL queries to retrieve, transform, and analyze your data. Snowflake supports standard SQL syntax.

* Step 9 - **Explore Additional Features**: Snowflake offers many advanced features, such as data sharing, data masking, and automated query optimization. Explore these features as you become more familiar with the platform.

* Step 10 - **Learn and Troubleshoot**: Snowflake provides comprehensive documentation and support resources. If you encounter issues or have questions, refer to the documentation or seek assistance from Snowflake's support channels.

## **Detailed View Inside Snowflake**

Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform that plays a crucial role in modern data engineering and analytics. It is designed to address the challenges of traditional on-premises data warehousing by providing a scalable, flexible, and fully managed cloud solution. Data engineers often work with Snowflake to design, build, and maintain data pipelines and warehouses.

* Cloud-Native Data Warehousing: Snowflake is a cloud-based, fully managed data warehousing platform that offers scalability and flexibility without the need for on-premises infrastructure.

* Data Integration and ETL: Data engineers can easily integrate data from various sources into Snowflake and set up data pipelines for ingestion, transformation, and loading.

* Data Security and Compliance: Snowflake prioritizes data security and compliance, providing encryption, access controls, audit logs, and masking features to protect sensitive data.

* Scalability and Concurrency: Snowflake's architecture allows for high concurrency and the ability to scale resources up or down as needed to handle varying workloads.

* SQL-Based Querying and Performance Optimization: Data engineers can use standard SQL for querying and analytics, benefiting from automatic query optimization and caching mechanisms to enhance performance.

## **SnowFalke Layers**

Snowflake's architecture is designed into three distinct layers, each with its own functionalities and scaling capabilities:

1. **Cloud Services Layer**
    * **Functionality**: Handles security, authentication, and authorization. It also manages query optimization.
    * **Interaction**: Every query passes through the Cloud Services Layer before reaching the Compute Layer.

2. **Compute Layer**
    * **Components**: Consists of Virtual Warehouses.
    * **Virtual Warehouses**: Clusters of nodes allocated from a cloud provider. Each warehouse operates independently, ensuring no performance impact between warehouses.
        * Scaling: Can be scaled horizontally (adding more clusters) or vertically (upgrading to more powerful nodes), and both can be done while the warehouse is live.
        * Auto Stop/Resume: Warehouses automatically stop when not in use and resume when needed, optimizing costs.
    * Types:
        * Standard Warehouse: General-purpose.
        * Snowpark Warehouse: Optimized for high-memory tasks like machine learning.

3. **Database Storage Layer**
    * **Management**: Fully managed by Snowflake. Handles file size, encryption, and data layout.
    * **Data Format**: Stored in an optimized columnar format, compressed, and encrypted.
    * **Access**: Data can only be accessed through Snowflake’s interface; direct visibility into storage details is not provided.

Key Points
* Scalability: Each layer can be scaled independently based on usage needs, and you only pay for what you use.
* Optimization: The architecture supports efficient performance and cost management through its independent scaling and auto-management features.
