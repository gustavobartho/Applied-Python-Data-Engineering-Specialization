# Applied Python Data Engineering Specialization

Specialization Link: https://www.coursera.org/programs/universidade-de-sao-paulo-br-on-coursera-mvxtw/specializations/python-data-engineering

Learn how to use data engineering to leverage big data for business strategy, data analysis, or machine learning and AI. By completing this course series, you'll empower yourself with the knowledge and proficiency required to build efficient data pipelines, manage cutting-edge platforms like Hadoop, Spark, Snowflake, Databricks, and Kubernetes, and tell stories with data through visualization. You will delve into foundational big data concepts, distributed computing with Spark, Snowflake’s architecture, Databricks’ machine learning capabilities, Python techniques for data visualization, and critical methodologies like DataOps. 

This course series is designed for software engineers, developers, researchers, and data scientists who want to strengthen their specialization in data science or machine learning, as well as for professionals who are interested in pursuing a career as a data-focused software engineer, data scientist, or a data engineer working in cloud, machine learning, business intelligence, or other field. 

Applied Learning Project

The Specialization features a capstone project focused on using Databricks’ API to replicate an existing project. This provides hands-on experience working with Databricks to build a portfolio-ready data solution. You will apply Python to a variety of data engineering tasks.

## Module 1 - Spark, Hadoop, and Snowflake for Data Engineering

Course Link: https://www.coursera.org/programs/universidade-de-sao-paulo-br-on-coursera-mvxtw/learn/spark-hadoop-snowflake-data-engineering

This is primarily aimed at first- and second-year undergraduates interested in engineering or science, along with high school students and professionals with an interest in programmingGain the skills for building efficient and scalable data pipelines. Explore essential data engineering platforms (Hadoop, Spark, and Snowflake) as well as learn how to optimize and manage them. Delve into Databricks, a powerful platform for executing data analytics and machine learning tasks, while honing your Python data science skills with PySpark. Finally, discover the key concepts of MLflow, an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, and learn how to integrate it with Databricks.

This course is designed for learners who want to pursue or advance their career in data science or data engineering, or for software developers or engineers who want to grow their data management skill set. In addition to the technologies you will learn, you will also gain methodologies to help you hone your project management and workflow skills for data engineering, including applying Kaizen, DevOps, and Data Ops methodologies and best practices.

#### This Module main goal are:
* Create scalable data pipelines (Hadoop, Spark, Snowflake, Databricks) for efficient data handling.
* Optimize data engineering with clustering and scaling to boost performance and resource use.
* Build ML solutions (PySpark, MLFlow) on Databricks for seamless model development and deployment.
* Implement DataOps and DevOps practices for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) of data-driven applications, including automating processes.
